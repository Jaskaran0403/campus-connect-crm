## Problem Statement  
Universities receive hundreds of academic and administrative queries from students each semester. Currently, these queries are managed manually via emails or paper forms, which results in:  
- Delays in response and resolution  
- Missed follow-ups  
- Lack of visibility into resolution timelines  

Additionally, student academic records are stored in scattered systems, making it difficult for faculty and administrators to quickly generate actionable insights.

- **Maintain Student Profiles & Course Details:** Store essential student information and course mappings, enabling quick reference and better tracking.  
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Enable dynamic dashboards for faculty, admin, and students to view query resolution progress and academic status at a glance.
