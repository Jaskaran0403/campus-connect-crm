## Problem Statement

Universities receive hundreds of academic and administrative queries from students each semester. Currently, these queries are managed manually via emails or paper forms, which results in:
- Delays in response and resolution
- Missed follow-ups
- Lack of visibility into resolution timelines

Additionally, student academic records are stored in scattered systems, making it difficult for faculty and administrators to quickly generate actionable insights.

- **Centralize Student Queries:** Provide a unified platform where all academic and administrative queries can be logged, tracked, and managed.
- **Automate Query Assignment:** Automatically route student queries to the appropriate department or personnel, ensuring faster and more accurate responses.
- **Maintain Student Profiles & Course Details:** Store essential student information and course mappings, enabling quick reference and better tracking.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Enable dynamic dashboards for faculty, admin, and students to view query resolution progress and academic status at a glance.
